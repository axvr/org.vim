#+TITLE: Org mode and Outline mode syntax highlighting for Vim

Org.vim is a minimal [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]] and
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Outline-Mode.html][Outline mode]]
plugin for [[https://www.vim.org][Vim]] providing only syntax highlighting and
folding.

This plugin aims to replicate Vim's [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown/][existing Markdown]]
editing experience on Org mode (and Outline mode) files, rather than trying to
be a full featured Org mode plugin—that is what Emacs is for.  Originally
created so I could use [[https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android/][Orgzly]]
without worrying about Emacs lock-in.

*Note*: this project is considered /feature complete/ by the author, so the
addition of new features will be unlikely.


** Installation

Installation of Org.vim can be performed by using your preferred plugin/package
management tool(s).  If you don't have a Vim package manager I recommend using
Vim 8 packages.

Just run these 2 commands from your shell.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/axvr/org.vim ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/org
vim +'helptags ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/org/doc/' +q
#+END_SRC

Make sure the following options are set in your vimrc to enable all
functionality:

#+BEGIN_SRC vim
syntax enable
filetype plugin indent on
#+END_SRC

Once installed check out the Org.vim manual (run ~:help org.txt~ to open it) for
usage information and configuration options.


** Screenshots

Different Vim colour schemes will result in different appearances.
